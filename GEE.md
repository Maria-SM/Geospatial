Google Earth Engine is a **cloud-based platform** for earth science and analysis. It helps with managing a lot of geospatial datasets.

What can GEE can do?
- Get an image
- apply an algorithm to an image
- filter a collection (series of images)
- map an algorithm over a collection
- reduce a collection
- compute aggregate statistics

Among the different geospatial processing functions you can perform are the following:
- Image collection
- Filter
- Reducer
- Join
- Export
- etc
